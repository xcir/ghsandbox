      <!---
          If your panic happens in the child_sigsegv_handler function, look at the
          backtrace to determine whether it is similar to another issue. When in
          doubt, open a new one and it will be closed as a duplicate if needed.
      -->
      <!--- If you're describing a bug, tell us what should happen -->
      <!--- If you're suggesting a change/improvement, tell us how it should work -->
      <!---
          If it's a packaging bug (including sysv or systemd services bugs) please
          open an issue on varnishcache/pkg-varnish-cache instead.
      -->

          If it's a feature request, please start a thread on the misc list instead.
