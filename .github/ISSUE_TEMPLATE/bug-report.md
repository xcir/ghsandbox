<!--- Things to check before you report a bug

    - Is the issue you are seeing clearly an issue in varnish core or
      could it be a support question? We do not use github issues for
      support questions, please refer to
      http://varnish-cache.org/support/index.html when in doubt.

    - For panics (varnish crashes), bug reports are most useful if

      - you are running recent code
	- ideally master
	- but at least the latest release of a supported version

      - you got
	- debuginfo packages installed when running binaries from
	  packages if these are available from the package source
	  you are using

	- or have compiled with debug information whenever possible
	  (configure --enable-debugging-symbols)

    If you have considered these recommendations, please go ahead and
    follow this template
-->
<!--- Provide a general summary of the issue in the Title above -->

## Expected Behavior
<!--- Did you check that there are no similar bug reports or pull requests? -->
<!---
    If your panic happens in the child_sigsegv_handler function, look at the
    backtrace to determine whether it is similar to another issue. When in
    doubt, open a new one and it will be closed as a duplicate if needed.
